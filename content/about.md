Working in the Bay Area for Volley Inc for the foreseeable future as one of our
first ten engineers. I work on core engine development - my prime directive is to do my best every day to support my colleagues.

My graduate topic of research was linear-temporal logic and its applications in verification of mission correctness in autonomous robotics.

My interests include machine learning, pure mathematics, programming,
programming language design (especially modern languages like NodeJS and Julia),
VR gaming/training development, and a whole host of other topics.
