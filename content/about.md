Hey there, I'm Michael Poteat and this is my online portfolio and blog, where I
broadcast and archive personal projects I work on, and discuss/post things I
find interesting online.

I work as a graduate research assistant at Old Dominion University. My current
topic of research is LTL (linear-temporal logic) and its application for
monitoring and verification of mission correctness in autonomous robotics. As
well, some future research planned will include utilization of machine learning
to produce temporal models that detect adverse operational conditions.

My interests include machine learning, pure mathematics, programming,
programming language design (especially modern languages like NodeJS and Julia),
VR gaming/training development, and a whole host of other topics.
